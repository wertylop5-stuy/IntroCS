2. Surface Pro 3, Windows 10
3. ISP: Verison
    FiOS (fiber optic)
	Bandwidth: 36.13 Mbps (I don't know if this is correct)
	I'm not sure why we use FiOS, but I think that it had some sort of deal that made it cheaper
	then other ISPs.
4. I think that the most interesting topic from intro1 was recursion. The premise of being able
    to write a program in such a way that it can utilize itself to solve a problem still seems
	mind blowing.
5. The most challenging topic from intro1 was recursion. I already knew the concept of recursion
    before the course (and had done some basic problems); however, I was not very good at it.
	I struggled on how my algorithms should be structured so that it could perform a task recursively.
6. I already some have prior knowledge of CS, more specifically the programming portion. I know some
    languages such as Java and C++. In addition, I know Javascript and C, but I wouldn't call myself
	anywhere near proficient with them. I try to actively teach myself programming on the side (as of
	writing, I am learning Ruby and SQL) and increasing my skills with the laguages I already know.
	This term, I'm very interested in learning Python and HTML.
